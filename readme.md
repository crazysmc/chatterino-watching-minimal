# chatterino-watching-minimal

Browser extension with minimal permissions to update the `/watching` split on
Chatterino.

Unlike the offical extension
[chatterino-browser-ext](/Chatterino/chatterino-browser-ext),
this extension does not implement any OS-specific chat replace feature, nor
does it request the browser permission to read all tabs' URLs.
Only URLs of `www.twitch.tv` tabs are visible to the extension.

In order to allow this extension to communicate with the Chatterino app, add
the extension ID in the browser integration settings.

The last selected Twitch stream is sent as a `select` message and the set of
all open Twitch streams is sent as a `sync` message.
Popout chat windows as well as Mod View pages are counted as watching a
stream.
